# Movie-recommendor-sytem

Welcome to the Movie Recommender System repository! This project utilizes machine learning techniques, TensorFlow, and Scikit-Learn to build a robust movie recommendation engine. The system analyzes user preferences and provides personalized movie suggestions, enhancing the user's movie-watching experience.

Key Features
Collaborative Filtering: Leverage collaborative filtering techniques to recommend movies based on user similarities and preferences.
Content-Based Filtering: Explore content-based filtering approaches that recommend movies by analyzing the characteristics of the movies and the user's historical preferences.
TensorFlow Implementation: Utilize TensorFlow to build and train neural network models, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of the recommendation system.
Scikit-Learn Integration: Employ Scikit-Learn for traditional machine learning models, providing a comparative analysis of different recommendation algorithms.
Data Preprocessing: Thorough data preprocessing to handle missing values, scale features, and encode categorical variables for optimal model training.
Project Structure
data: Contains datasets used for training and testing the recommendation models.
notebooks: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model development, and evaluation.
src: Source code for the recommendation system implementation, including TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn models.
docs: Documentation for the project, including model explanations, usage guidelines, and performance metrics.
